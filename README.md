* Data cleaning and pre-processing
* Data analysis and visualization
* Matrix correlation
* Machine Learning (ML): data modeling
    * Classifation: to predict a player's position based on his skills (attributes)
    * Numerical Regression: to predict a player's value in CAD based on his skills (attributes)
